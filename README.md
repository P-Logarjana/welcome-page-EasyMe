EasyMe - E-Commerce Website

EasyMe is an e-commerce platform designed to offer an intuitive and seamless shopping experience. This project was developed as part of a group assignment during my first year. 
I contributed to the project by designing and developing the Welcome Page of the website, ensuring it was user-friendly and visually appealing.

Features
Welcome Page: A clean and modern design with clear navigation to help users get started with their shopping experience.

Product Listings: Categories for browsing through various products.
